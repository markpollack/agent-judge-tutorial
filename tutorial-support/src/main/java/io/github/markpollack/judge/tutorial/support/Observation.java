/**
 * Something useful learned while establishing a judgment, which is not itself a judgment.
 *
 * <p>The distinction is the point:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Judgment     did the implementation satisfy the requirement?
 *   Observation  what did we learn while establishing that?
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A requirement can be fully PASS and still produce one of these. When the judge established
 * that owner cancellation is correctly rejected at the exact start instant, it also noticed that no
 * existing test exercises that boundary. The requirement says the implementation must behave
 * correctly there; it does not say a test must exist. So the criterion passes, and the gap is worth
 * keeping.
 *
 * <p><b>An observation is non-binding.</b> It never enters the roster, never changes PASS to FAIL or
 * ABSTAIN, is not a new criterion, is not a warning status, and is not a score. It rides in
 * {@code Judgment.metadata()}, which participates in no rollup.
 *
 * <p>We must not fit the rubric after seeing the implementation. The roster comes from the
 * specification, and a missing test is not silently promoted into a requirement nobody wrote.
 *
 * @param requirementId the criterion this was noticed while establishing
 * @param message one externally verifiable sentence
 * @param locations file:line references extracted from the message, possibly empty
