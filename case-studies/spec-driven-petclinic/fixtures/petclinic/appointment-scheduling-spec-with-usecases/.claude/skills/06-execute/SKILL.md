description: Execute the implementation plan in spec/tasks.yaml task by task, validating each against its acceptance criteria and halting at checkpoints. Use this skill whenever the user asks to implement, execute, run, continue, or work on a plan; when a spec/ directory with tasks.yaml exists in the repo; when they reference task or phase IDs (task-N.M, phase-N); or when they ask to start the next task or phase.

# Execute Skill

Execute the pre-approved implementation plan in `spec/tasks.yaml` task by task, validate each task, and halt at
checkpoints for approval.

This is the implementation phase of a spec-driven development workflow, after the plan has been generated and the review
has gated it as ready.

Pipeline position: proposal → spec → criteria → rules → review → plan → **execute**

# Role

You execute tasks in order, validate them, and report progress. You do not modify anything under `/spec/` except
`status.md`. You do not skip tasks, reorder them, or proceed past checkpoints without explicit approval.

# Inputs

- Plan: @file:spec/tasks.yaml (task list)
- Acceptance criteria: @file:spec/criteria.md (validation source)
- Technical constraints: @file:spec/rules.md (constraint set)
- Feature context: @file:spec/spec.md
- Pipeline verdict and risk hotspots: @file:spec/review.md
- Progress: @file:spec/status.md (you maintain this; create if missing)

# Initialization

When starting work:

1. Read `tasks.yaml`. This is your task list.
2. Read `criteria.md` and `rules.md`.
3. Read `spec.md` for feature context and `review.md` for risk hotspots that map to specific tasks.
4. Read `status.md` to find your position. If it doesn't exist, create it with `phase-1` / `task-1.1` as `NOT_STARTED`.
5. Set `current_task` to the first task with status `NOT_STARTED`.

# Execution Loop

For each task:

1. **Verify prerequisites.** For every `task_id` in `task.depends_on`, confirm its status is `COMPLETE` in `status.md`.
   If not, halt with a Blocker report.

2. **Mark in progress.** Update `status.md`: set the task to `IN_PROGRESS`.

3. **Execute.** Read the task's `description`, `artifact`, `covers.acs`, and `covers.rules`. Produce or update the
   artifact, plus any supporting files (tests, fixtures, configs) needed to satisfy validation. Apply every constraint
   listed in `covers.rules`. Do not modify files unrelated to this task.

4. **Validate.** Run the check described in `task.validation`. Then verify every AC in `covers.acs` is satisfied,
   typically through passing tests or behavioral checks against `criteria.md`. If validation fails, take up to two
   corrective attempts. Each attempt must be a different approach, not a re-run of the same code. If still failing after
   two attempts, halt with a Blocker report.

5. **Mark complete.** Update `status.md`: set the task to `COMPLETE`. Record any non-obvious decisions in the notes.

6. **Advance.** If more tasks remain in the phase, set `current_task` to the next one. If this was the last task of the
   phase, generate a Checkpoint report and halt for approval.

When all phases complete, generate a Completion report.

# Approval Responses

After a Checkpoint report, wait for one of:

- `APPROVED`: proceed to the next phase.
- `APPROVED WITH NOTES: <notes>`: record notes in `status.md`, then proceed.
- `REVISE: task-N.M - <instructions>`: apply the revision to the named task, re-validate, then resume.
- `ROLLBACK: task-N.M`: mark the named task `NOT_STARTED`, undo its artifact, then resume from there.
- `BLOCKED: <reason>`: record blocker in `status.md` and halt.

After a Blocker report, wait for one of:

- `PROCEED WITH: <option number>`: continue using the specified option from the report.
- `PROCEED WITH: <custom instructions>`: continue using user-provided guidance.
- `ABORT TASK`: skip this task and adjust the plan.

# Status File Format

Maintain `spec/status.md` with only the delta from `tasks.yaml`. Everything else is derivable.

```markdown
# Status: <feature>

## Current

- Task: task-N.M
- Status: IN_PROGRESS | NOT_STARTED | BLOCKED

## Completed

- task-1.1
- task-1.2

## Phase Approvals

- phase-1: APPROVED
- phase-2: PENDING

## Blockers

(empty if none)

## Deviations

(approved deviations from plan, with task ID and reason)

## Notes

(non-obvious decisions, per task)
```

# Checkpoint Report

## Open Items

# Rules

- The `/spec/` directory is read-only during implementation. The single exception is `status.md`, which you maintain.
- Do not skip tasks or reorder within a phase.
- Do not proceed past a checkpoint without an approval response.
- Do not proceed when blocked without a resolution response.
- A task may touch supporting files (tests, fixtures, configs) needed to satisfy `validation`, but must not modify files
  unrelated to the task's `artifact` and coverage.
- Record non-obvious decisions in the per-task notes in `status.md`.
